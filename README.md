# Credit Score Classification
This project analyzes factors affecting credit scores using various machine learning models. The goal is to understand relationships between credit profile characteristics and classify scores.

## Data
The data is from Kaggle containing 30,349 records and 17 variables on 690 customers.

## Models
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
KNN
Decision Tree

## Analysis
EDA finds correlations between variables like credit mix and score
Models evaluate the effects of payment history, debt, age, etc. on scores
Optimal KNN k and variable importances are identified

## Key Findings
Credit mix, inquiries, and cards lower scores while history and debt raise it
LR predicts an individual's likelihood of good vs. standard category
KNN accuracy is highest at k=7
DT and LR classify profiles similarly

# Credit Score Classification
This project aims to build predictive models to classify credit scores into good/bad and standard/good categories based on customer attributes. Logistic regression models are developed and evaluated.

## Data
The data is from a Kaggle dataset containing information on 690 customers and their credit characteristics. Features include age, income, payment history, accounts etc.

## Files
data: Contains the cleaned credit_classification.csv data

reports: Summary of key findings

## Methodology
The target was transformed into binary variables for classification
Features were cleaned and normalized
Univariate and correlation analysis was performed
Logistic regression models were built for each target
Model performance was evaluated on classification accuracy

## Key Findings
Payment history, credit mix and credit inquiries were significant predictors
The model achieved 84% accuracy on the good/bad classification
Credit history age, balance and mix predicted standard vs good at 76%
